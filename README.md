# Python-Projects
In this Repository, I got acquainted with the basic syntax of Python. I  worked with different types of data, use standard and third-party libraries, and learn to handle most common errors in your code.
Also I  easily wrote programs to automate everyday tasks, get and process data from different sources (files, databases, web-pages), or develop a console app. Starting from simple projects like programming the Hangman game, I  move on to more challenging ones and able to implement my own browser, hack passwords, and also  created a website!
